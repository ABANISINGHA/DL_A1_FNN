Neural Network Model for Fashion-MNIST Classification

This repository contains code for training and evaluating a neural network model for Fashion-MNIST image classification using various optimization techniques and hyperparameters tuning. The model is implemented in Python using libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Keras.

Dataset: The Fashion-MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 classes. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale representation of various fashion items.

In this project, we aim to develop a deep learning model to classify Fashion-MNIST images into 10 categories. The model architecture includes multiple hidden layers with different activation functions and optimization algorithms. We also explore hyperparameter tuning using Grid and Bayesian optimization techniques.

Used optimizers: 

Stochastic gradient decent

Momentum based gradient decent
